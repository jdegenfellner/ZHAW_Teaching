# Training a simple neuronal network using backpropagation

# in progress # 

# (Initial) instruction to GPT-4:
# "I want to explain backpropagation training to my students. I want to 
# present a nice R script showing step by step the training process for a 
# small, simple neural network.
# So, let's use a data set that is included in R or in one of it's popular 
# packages and do that. Maybe you can also visualize the updated weights 
# in a step by step manner as the training data comes in."
